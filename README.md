# YSPH-Career-Outcome
The YSPH Career Outcomes project contains a fully functional database and an user-interface website with Flask framework. I received the 2018 - 2021 Yale School of Public Health (YSPH) graduation outcomes from the career center due to my curiosity.   
Steps: 1. I imported the dataset into MySQL server, so we could have a easier way to check the career pathways for YSPH graduates.
